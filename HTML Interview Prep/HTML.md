2. **What are HTML tags and attributes?**  
   👉 Tags are keywords enclosed in `< >` that define elements (e.g., `<p>`).  
   👉 Attributes provide additional information about elements (e.g., `<img src="image.jpg" alt="logo">`).  

3. **Difference between HTML and CSS?**  
   👉 HTML defines **structure** of a page, CSS defines **style** (colors, fonts, layouts).  

4. **What is the difference between `<div>` and `<span>`?**  
   👉 `<div>` is a **block-level element** (takes full width).  
   👉 `<span>` is an **inline element** (takes only required space).  

---

### 🟡 Intermediate Level
1. **What is the difference between HTML and HTML5?**  
   👉 HTML5 introduced new semantic elements (`<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`), multimedia support (`<audio>`, `<video>`), and APIs (Canvas, LocalStorage).  

2. **What are semantic HTML elements? Give examples.**  
   👉 Semantic elements describe the **meaning** of content (e.g., `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`).  

3. **What is the difference between `id` and `class`?**

   - Proper heading structure (`<h1>`, `<h2>`).  

2. **What are meta tags in HTML?**  
   👉 Meta tags provide metadata about the page (e.g., charset, description, viewport).  
   Example:  
   ```html
   <meta charset="UTF-8">
