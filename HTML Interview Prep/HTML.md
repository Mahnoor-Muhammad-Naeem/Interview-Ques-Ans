## 📝 Interview Questions & Answers

### 🟢 Beginner Level
1. **What is HTML?**  
   👉 HTML is a markup language used to structure web content. It uses elements (tags) to define different parts of a webpage.  

2. **What are HTML tags and attributes?**  
   👉 Tags are keywords enclosed in `< >` that define elements (e.g., `<p>`).  
   👉 Attributes provide additional information about elements (e.g., `<img src="image.jpg" alt="logo">`).  

3. **Difference between HTML and CSS?**  
   👉 HTML defines **structure** of a page, CSS defines **style** (colors, fonts, layouts).  

4. **What is the difference between `<div>` and `<span>`?**  
   👉 `<div>` is a **block-level element** (takes full width).  
   👉 `<span>` is an **inline element** (takes only required space).

### 🟡 Intermediate Level
1. **What is the difference between HTML and HTML5?**  
   👉 HTML5 introduced new semantic elements (`<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`), multimedia support (`<audio>`, `<video>`), and APIs (Canvas, LocalStorage).  

2. **What are semantic HTML elements? Give examples.**  
   👉 Semantic elements describe the **meaning** of content (e.g., `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`).  

3. **What is the difference between `id` and `class`?**  
   👉 `id` is **unique** and used once per page.  
   👉 `class` can be reused for multiple elements.  

4. **Explain difference between inline, block, and inline-block elements.**  
   👉 **Block**: starts on new line, takes full width (e.g., `<div>`, `<p>`).  
   👉 **Inline**: does not start new line, takes only content width (e.g., `<span>`, `<a>`).  
   👉 **Inline-block**: acts like inline but allows width/height to be set.  

---

### 🔴 Advanced Level
1. **What are Web Accessibility standards in HTML?**  
   👉 Accessibility means making websites usable for everyone, including people with disabilities. Examples:  
   - Use `alt` attributes for images.  
   - Use ARIA roles (`role="navigation"`).  
   - Proper heading structure (`<h1>`, `<h2>`).  

2. **What are meta tags in HTML?**  
   👉 Meta tags provide metadata about the page (e.g., charset, description, viewport).  
   Example:  
   ```html
   <meta charset="UTF-8">
   <meta name="description" content="Learn HTML easily">
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
